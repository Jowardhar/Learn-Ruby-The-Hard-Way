# prints string
puts "Mary had a little lamb."
# prints string with interpolation with string
puts "It's fleece was white as #{'snow'}."
puts "And everywhere that Mary went."
# prints string "." and multiply by 10
puts "." * 10 # what'd that do

# variables for each character
end1 = "C"
end2 = "h"
end3 = "e"
end4 = "e"
end5 = "s"
end6 = "e"
end7 = "B"
end8 = "u"
end9 = "r"
end10 = "g"
end11 = "e"
end12 = "r"

# watch that print vs. puts on this line what's it do?

# prints variables beside one another
print end1 + end2 + end3 + end4 + end5 + end6
# prints variables beside the print output
puts end7 + end8 + end9 + end10 + end11 + end12
