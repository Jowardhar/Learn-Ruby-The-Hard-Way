require     = Require runs another file, also tracks what you have required in the past and wont require the same file.
          
            * Ruby Doc: Loads the given name, returning true if successful and false if the feature is already loaded.
          
Module      = Modules are about providing methods that you can use a-cross classes. Classes are objects; modules are 
            about functions.
            
            * Ruby Doc: A Module is a collection of methods and constants. The methods in a module may be instance methods 
            or module methods. Instance methods appear as methods in a class when the module is included, module methods 
            do not. Conversely, module methods may be called without creating an encapsulating object, while instance 
            methods may not.
            
class       = A Class is an object type wich is initialized and assigned to the glabal constant.

||=         = assigns the value on the right hand side to the left like '=' operator, if the left hand side returns the
            value of 'nil' or 'false'. Peter Cooper "If the left hand side of the comparison is true, there is no need 
                                                    to check the right hand side"

FileUtils.mkdir_p = Creates one or more file directories
        
            * Ruby DOc: Creates a directory and all its parent directories.

FileUtils.cp = Copies a files content to the destination
            
            * Ruby Doc: Copies a file content src to dest. If dest is a directory, copies src to dest/src.

File.expand_path = get's the absolute pathname of a file (unsure what this means or does)

            * Ruby DOc: Converts a pathname to an absolute pathname. Relative paths are referenced from the current working 
            directory of the process unless dir_string is given, in which case it will be used as the starting point. The 
            given pathname may start with a “~”, which expands to the process owner’s home directory (the environment 
            variable HOME must be set correctly). “~user” expands to the named user’s home directory.
            
ERB.new     = constructs a new erb object 

            * Ruby Doc: Constructs a new ERB object with the template specified in str.
            An ERB object works by building a chunk of Ruby code that will output the completed template when run
